# ⚡ Bash Script Arcade: Terminal Utilities with Style

```bash
Welcome to the simulation...
Initializing terminal tools...
Access level: USER
```

This isn’t just another beginner scripting repo.  
This is your **entry point into Bash wizardry**, a *command-line arcade* where automation, interaction, and hacker vibes collide.

Built during my **freeCodeCamp Relational Database Certification**, these micro-programs flex fundamentals while proving the terminal can be more than a place for commands — it can be fun, functional, and cool.

| Script           | Functionality & Theme                                                 |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `bingo.sh`       | 🎲 **Bingo Number Caller** — Generates a random B-I-N-G-O number, spoken like you're running the game. |
| `countdown.sh`   | ⏳ **Countdown Timer** — Counts down from any number. Includes a commented-out `for` loop for alt syntax. |
| `fortune.sh`     | 🔮 **Fortune Teller** — Ask a yes/no question, get a randomized future response from the Bash void. |
| `questionnaire.sh` | 🗣️ **User Questionnaire** — Terminal-based survey with dynamic echo response. |
| `five.sh`      | 🧩 **Master Launcher** — Runs all the scripts like you're booting up an old-school hacker OS. |

## 🧠 Tech & Concepts Used

- `if`, `elif`, `case` conditionals
- `while` and `for` loops
- Random number generation
- `sleep`, `echo`, `read`
- Arrays and input validation
- Script chaining (`./five.sh` launches others)

---

## 🤔 Why This Exists

Because Bash scripting is **more than just automation** — it’s power at your fingertips. Whether you're building CI/CD pipelines, securing servers, or just showing off at the terminal, knowing how to command the shell is *core developer DNA*.

This project marks another checkpoint in my journey toward becoming a **secure full stack engineer**.

---

## 📦 Future Enhancements
- ASCII-styled UI or `tput` terminal effects
- Color-coded CLI output (like red/yellow/green results)
- Logging features and input flags (`--help`, `-n`, etc.)
- Bash unit testing with `bats-core`
